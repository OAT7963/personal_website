          # I started my academic journey as an Actuarial Science student before transitioning to Mechanical Engineering, and ultimately pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science.


          # In my final year of university, I discovered my passion for data, but it was too late to switch degrees, so I embarked on a self-taught journey to learn data science.
          

          # I knew that breaking into the tech industry would not be easy without a formal data science or IT degree. However, through self-study and hard work, I developed the skills I needed to land my first job  in a local data analytics startup before moving on to a multinational and international tech company. 
          

          # Here's how I did it."
