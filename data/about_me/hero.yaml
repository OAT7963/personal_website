  title: "Unlock Your Potential: Choose My Expertise for Your Early Career Success"
  text: "Throughout my educational journey, my interests have spanned various fields. In high school, I was drawn to law, architecture, and engineering, largely influenced by public opinion at the time. Upon completing my SPM, I developed a strong affinity for Chemistry, which led me to apply to Sunway University, where I chose a blend of science and business subjects. After attending an accounting class, I realized it wasnâ€™t for me. Consequently, halfway through the course, I transitioned to the Foundation in Science program at Heriot Watt University. From there, my academic path took me through Actuarial Science, followed by two years of Mechanical Engineering, and finally to Environmental Science, where I completed my degree. During the pandemic, I took advantage of the time to enhance my data skills."
