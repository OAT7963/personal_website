          Throughout my educational and personal journey, my interests spanned multiple fields (Contemporary dance, Law, Engineering and Science). 
          
          
          In high school, I was drawn to law, architecture, and engineering, largely influenced by public opinion at the time. Upon completing my SPM, I developed a strong affinity for Chemistry, which led me to apply to Sunway University. 
          
          
          In college is where I chose a blend of science and business subjects. After attending an accounting class, I realized it wasnâ€™t for me. As a result, halfway through the course, I transitioned to the Foundation in Science program at Heriot Watt University. 
  

          From there, my academic path took me through Actuarial Science, followed by two years of Mechanical Engineering, and finally to Environmental Science, where I finally completed my degree.

          Here's how I did it."
