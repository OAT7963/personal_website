## Importance of Technical Documentation

Technical documentation is essential in any tech project as it provides users and stakeholders with a detailed understanding of the product's functionality. It also serves as a guide for developers and maintainers, reducing the onboarding time and ensuring consistency in product development and troubleshooting. It plays a vital role in communication among teams, facilitating better collaboration and efficiency.

## Role of Non-Technical Documentation

Non-technical documentation is equally important as it communicates the project's purpose, goals, and strategies to non-technical stakeholders.

It helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project, regardless of their technical expertise, understands and aligns with the project's objectives.

Regular updating and maintaining of documentation ensure it remains relevant and useful over the project's lifecycle.
